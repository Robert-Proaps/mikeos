## IMPORTANT! When uplaoding to your webserver copy index.html to the root directory of the website outside of the html folder, but keep a copy inside the html folder as well.

Stylesheets can be found in /stylesheets
Your webpages go in /html
Any pictures or art or videos or fonts go in /assets and can be sorted into corresponding subfolders as needed. See the fonts example.
When refferencing a file use ../ to specify the root directly above /html or /css.
DO NOT HOT LINK TO PEOPLSE ASSETS!

Keep photos small as tinkerhost has a limit on file size, though this should not really be an issue. If you need custom graphics consider an inline <svg>
